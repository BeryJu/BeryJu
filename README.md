### 'ello

I build software around Identity and SSO, and also other things sometimes.

I mainly work on [authentik](https://github.com/goauthentik/authentik), an IDP focused on being easy to use and flexible, and also make a couple tools to test Identity protocols:

- [saml-test-sp](https://github.com/BeryJu/saml-test-sp)
- [oidc-test-client](https://github.com/BeryJu/oidc-test-client)
- [oauth1-test-server](https://github.com/BeryJu/oauth1-test-server)

Also for some reason I decided to make my own DHCP and DNS Server, [Gravity](https://github.com/BeryJu/gravity).

I also like to use a lot of IaC workflows for my lab, like [infrastructure](https://github.com/BeryJu/infrastructure) with Ansible/Puppet/Terraform and [k8s](https://github.com/BeryJu/k8s) with [Flux](https://fluxcd.io/).
